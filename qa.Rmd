### **Will there be a Stag & Doe?**

### Yes! We are planning on having a Stag & Doe in Sarnia, Ontario (Brandon's hometown) in Spring 2024. Stay tuned for more details on that. For those of you outside Ontario, [see this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_and_doe) about what a Stag & Doe is!

### **Are children welcome?**

### Yes! Children may come to the ceremony, and may join us at the reception until 9:30 PM when the bar becomes strictly 19+.



### **Is this wedding indoor or outdoors?**

### We are hoping for outdoor ceremony with an indoor reception, but will have weather plans in place!

### **What about transportation between the ceremony and reception?**

### We will provide more details about this with the formal invitation.


### **What should I wear?**

### Dressy casual or cocktail. The ceremony location may have some uneven ground, so make sure you wear shoes that you are comfortable wearing on grass!

### **Will you be feeding us?**

### Yes, more details about the menu to follow.

### **What about a gift registry?**

### Your presence is a good enough present! We realize the costs associated with getting and staying here to celebrate with us, and so we are not asking for gifts. If you would like to contribute to our honeymoon, we of course would be incredibly grateful. Details coming soon...
